# MQ135_air_quality_measuring_device
This is a small device that was built to measure the air quality around you using a MQ135 sensor which is specifically made to measure the air quality
Here the direct external power supply didnt make the device work properly. So i added a few diodes so it can decrease the voltage that was given to the components to 3.3 V which is a voltage that can make everything work.
The diode circuit is attached as an image
